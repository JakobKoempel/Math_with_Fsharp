# Highly divisible triangular num

In this problem the question was to find the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors. A sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. Triangular numbers can be visualised like this using triangles:

The **n**th triangular number can also be defined as **n** * (**n** + 1) / 2 by calculating the area of the triangle as shown in the following picture:
