# Digit factoria chain

The 74th problem was slightly more difficult to solve. As in April 2018, only 20000 people solved it so far. 
In this problem the task was to find digit factorial chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms? 
A digit factorial chain is a sequence of natural numbers which is created as follows:  
The next number of the sequence is determined by summing the factorials of all digits in the previous number.
This sequences will allaways end in a loop. For example:    
69 → 363600 → **1454** → 169 → 363601 → **1454**
